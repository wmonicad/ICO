# ICO
This is a project we did at the 5th Unhackathon organized by Data Science Hong Kong. Our team's project was to look at ICO data extracted from ICOBench to determine which ICOs are scams. Given we only had a few hours to work on it at the Unhackathon, we focused on data wrangling and visualization to learn more about the ICO landscape. After the Unhackathon, I had spent some time to conduct simple analysis of a few additional features. As we did not have sufficient data to determine which ICOs are scams, I would rather focus on determining which ICOs have higher returns on investment instead.
